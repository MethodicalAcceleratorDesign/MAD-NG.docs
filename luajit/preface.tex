This document describes the details of the LuaJIT project with a particular focus on the concept of trace-based just-in-time compilation. It aims to be a general guide especially for newcomers of this topic. This document takes its birth from a recent Master thesis project \cite{dandrea2019madng} that was carried out at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research.

Before to start, we want to express our gratitude to the author of LuaJIT, Mike Pall, and to its community for all the useful insights contained in the LuaJIT mailing list.
