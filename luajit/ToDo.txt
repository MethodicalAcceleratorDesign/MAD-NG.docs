**** LuaJIT ****
ok	- Logical transformation
ok		* a and b
ok		* a or b
ok		* combination: a and b or c / a or b and c
ok		* function: a and b or nil
ok	- Canonical transformations
ok		* while
ok		* for
ok		* repeat until
ok		* generic for - ipairs
ok	- Stitch trace
ok	- Snapshot
	- Explain the mechanism of Blacklisting a side trace -> force interpretation
	- Doc: Review chapthers organization
		* Canonical transformations before trace combinations?
ok		* Unifiy chapther on background and related works
	- Doc: Variable allocations must be included?
	- Doc: Explaination of LuaJIT Architecture
	- Doc: Include Aurelien chapthers in the doc
		* Explain VM states in the doc (Aurelien did not mention them...)
	- Doc: Explaination of how LuaJIT is compiled
	- Doc: Explain function inlining. Where?
		* Why a function is compiled independently only if it is called twice in 2 different loops?
	- Doc: chapther of tools muct be included. Where?
	- Doc: BC, IR, and Mcode must be included. Where?
		* Should we add my patch in the doc? No
	- Unanswered: ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomisation) is a problem or not?
		* Search how to disable it on MAC
	- Unanswered: Difference between up-recursion and down-recursion
	- Unanswered: Explain all the case of aborts
	- Unanswered: How to solve the problem of generic loop iterators not compiled because of next()
		* Use a mechanism similar to stitch trace. Why Mike Pall did not do it by himself?
		* Analyse lj_tab_next() in lj_tab.c
	- Unanswered: Why all the NYI are not surrounded by stich traces?
	- Unanswered: Can stitch trace be applied to solve the blacklisting cancer?


**** RaptorJIT ****
	- Study the way blacklisting is implemented in RaptorJIT
	- Is it worth to switch to RaptorJIT?


**** MAD ****
	- Analyse the traces generated by ONLY running MAD. 
		* Why there is a trace flush after creating 4 TRACES when running MAD?
	- Analyse how asserts are treated by LuaJIT (MAD makes large use of asserts)
	- Analyse critical parts of MAD when running 


**** Strategy - Analysis Tools ****
	- Clean script
	- Which features must be implemented for the strategy?
	- Function to search parent O(n^2) must be in O(n)
	- Should we move my patch of the dump to jdump level or it can remain in C?


**** To do ****
	- Make a list of publication related to tracing JIT
	- Publish the thesis on CERN CDS
	- Publish the Doc on LuaJIT mailing list
