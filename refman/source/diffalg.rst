This chapter describes real :type:`tpsa` and complex :type:`ctpsa` objects as supported by MAD-NG. The module for the Generalized Truncated Power Series Algebra (GTPSA) that represents parametric multivariate finite `Taylor Series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series>`_ is not exposed, only the contructors are visible from the :mod:`MAD` environment and thus, TPSAs are handled directly by their methods or by the generic functions of the same name from the module :mod:`MAD.gmath`. Note that both :type:`tpsa` and :type:`ctpsa` are defined as C structure for direct compliance with the C API.
