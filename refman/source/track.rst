Command synopsis
----------------


The ``track`` command format is summarized in :numref:`fig-track-synop`, including the default setup of the attributes.

The ``track`` command supports the following attributes:

	**sequence**
	 The *sequence* to track. (no default, required). 
	 Example: :expr:`sequence = lhcb1`.

	**beam** 
	 The reference *beam* for the tracking. If no beam is provided, the command looks for a beam attached to the sequence, i.e. the attribute ``seq.beam``. [#f2]_ (default: ``nil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`beam = beam 'lhcbeam' { ... }` where ... are the *beam-attributes*.

	**range** 
	 A *range* specifying the span of the sequence track. If no range is provided, the command looks for a range attached to the sequence, i.e. the attribute . (default: ``nil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`range = "S.DS.L8.B1/E.DS.R8.B1"`.

	**dir**
	 The :math:`s`-direction of the tracking: ``1`` forward, ``-1`` backward. (default: 1). 
	 Example: :expr:`dir = - 1`.

	**s0** 
	 A *number* specifying the initial :math:`s`-position offset. (default: :math:`0` [m]). 
	 Example: :expr:`s0 = 5000`.

	**X0** 
 	 A *mappable* (or a list of *mappable*) specifying initial coordinates ``{x,px,y,py,t,pt}``, damap, or beta block for each tracked object, i.e. particle or damap. The beta blocks are converted to damaps, while the coordinates are converted to damaps only if ``mapdef`` is specified, but both will use ``mapdef`` to setup the damap constructor. Each tracked object may also contain a ``beam`` to override the reference beam, and a *logical* ``nosave`` to discard this object from being saved in the mtable. (default: 0). 
	 Example: :expr:`X0 = { x=1e- 3, px=- 1e- 5 }`.

	**O0**
	 A *mappable* specifying initial coordinates ``{x,px,y,py,t,pt}`` of the reference orbit around which X0 definitions take place. If it has the attribute :expr:`cofind == true`, it will be used as an initial guess to search for the reference closed orbit. (default: 0). 
	 Example: :expr:`O0 = { x=1e- 4, px=- 2e- 5, y=- 2e- 4, py=1e- 5 }`.

	**deltap**
	 A *number* (or list of *number*) specifying the initial :math:`\delta_p` to convert (using the beam) and add to the ``pt`` of each tracked particle or damap. (default: ``nil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`s0 = 5000`.

	**nturn**
	 A *number* specifying the number of turn to track. (default: 2). 
	 Example: :expr:`nturn = 2`.

	**nstep**
	 A *number* specifying the number of element to track. A negative value will track all elements. (default: -1). 
	 Example: :expr:`nstep = 1`.

	**nslice** 
	 A *number* specifying the number of slices or an *iterable* of increasing relative positions or a *callable* ``(elm, mflw, lw)`` returning one of the two previous kind of positions to track in the elements. The arguments of the callable are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, and the length weight of the step. This attribute can be locally overridden by the element. (default: 1). 
	 Example: :expr:`nslice = 5`.

	**mapdef** 
	 A *logical* or a *damap* specification as defined by the :doc:`DAmap <diffmap>` module to track DA maps instead of particles coordinates. A value of ``true`` is equivalent to invoke the *damap* constructor with ``{}`` as argument. This attribute allows to track DA maps instead of particles. (default: ``nil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`mapdef = { xy=2, pt=5 }`.

	**method** 
	 A *number* specifying the order of integration from 1 to 8, or a *string* specifying a special method of integration. Odd orders are rounded to the next even order to select the corresponding Yoshida or Boole integration schemes. The special methods are ``simple`` (equiv. to ``DKD`` order 2), ``collim`` (equiv. to ``MKM`` order 2), and ``teapot`` (Teapot splitting order 2). (default: 2). 
	 Example: :expr:`method = 'teapot'`.

	**model** 
	 A *string* specifying the integration model, either ``'DKD'`` for *Drift-Kick-Drift* thin lens integration or ``'TKT'`` for *Thick-Kick-Thick* thick lens integration. [#f3]_ (default: ``'TKT'``)  
	 Example: :expr:`model = 'DKD'`.

	**ptcmodel** 
	 A *logical* indicating to use strict PTC model. [#f7]_ (default: ``nil``) 
	 Example: :expr:`ptcmodel = true`.

	**implicit**
	 A *logical* indicating that implicit elements must be sliced too, e.g. for smooth plotting. (default: ). 
	 Example: :expr:`implicit = true`.

	**misalign**
	 A *logical* indicating that misalignment must be considered. (default: ``false``). 
	 Example: :expr:`misalign = true`.

	**fringe**
	 A *logical* indicating that fringe fields must be considered or a *number* specifying a bit mask to apply to all elements fringe flags defined by the element module. The value ``true`` is equivalent to the bit mask , i.e. allow all elements (default) fringe fields. (default: ``true``). 
	 Example: :expr:`fringe = false`.

	**radiate**
	 A *logical* enabling or disabling the radiation or a *string* specifying the type of radiation: ``'average'`` or ``'quantum'``. The value ``true`` is equivalent to ``'average'``. The value ``'quantum+photon'`` enables the tracking of emitted photons. (default: ``false``). 
	 Example: :expr:`radiate = 'quantum'`.

	**totalpath** 
	 A *logical* indicating to use the totalpath for the fifth variable ``'t'`` instead of the local path. (default: ``false``). 
	 Example: :expr:`totalpath = true`.

	**save** 
	 A *logical* specifying to create a *mtable* and record tracking information at the observation points. The ``save`` attribute can also be a *string* specifying saving positions in the observed elements: ``"atentry"``, ``"atslice"``, ``"atexit"`` (i.e. ``true``), ``"atbound"`` (i.e. entry and exit), ``"atbody"`` (i.e. slices and exit) and ``"atall"``. (default: ``true``). 
	 Example: :expr:`save = false`.

	**title** 
	 A *string* specifying the title of the *mtable*. If no title is provided, the command looks for the name of the sequence, i.e. the attribute ``seq.name``. (default: ``nil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`title = "track around IP5"`.

	**observe** 
	 A *number* specifying the observation points to consider for recording the tracking information. A zero value will consider all elements, while a positive value will consider selected elements only, checked with method :meth:`:is_observed`, every ``observe`` :math:`>0` turns. (default: ``1`` ). 
	 Example: :expr:`observe = 1`.

	**savesel**
	 A *callable* ``(elm, mflw, lw, islc)`` acting as a predicate on selected elements for observation, i.e. the element is discarded if the predicate returns ``false``. The arguments are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, the length weight of the slice and the slice index. (default: ``fnil``) 
	 Example: :expr:`savesel = \LMB e -> mylist ~= nil`.

	**savemap** 
	 A *logical* indicating to save the damap in the column ``__map`` of the *mtable*. (default: ``false``). 
	 Example: :expr:`savemap = true`.

	**atentry** 
	 A *callable* ``(elm, mflw, 0, - 1)`` invoked at element entry. The arguments are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, zero length and the slice index . (default: ``fnil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`atentry = myaction`.

	**atslice** 
	 A *callable* ``(elm, mflw, lw, islc)`` invoked at element slice. The arguments are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, the length weight of the slice and the slice index. (default: ``fnil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`atslice = myaction`.

	**atexit** 
	 A *callable* ``(elm, mflw, 0, - 2)`` invoked at element exit. The arguments are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, zero length and the slice index . (default: ``fnil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`atexit = myaction`.

	**ataper** 
	 A *callable* ``(elm, mflw, lw, islc)`` invoked at element aperture checks, by default at last slice. The arguments are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, the length weight of the slice and the slice index. If a particle or a damap hits the aperture, then its ``status = "lost"`` and it is removed from the list of tracked items. (default: ``fnil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`ataper = myaction`.

	**atsave** 
	 A *callable* ``(elm, mflw, lw, islc)`` invoked at element saving steps, by default at exit. The arguments are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, the length weight of the slice and the slice index. (default: ``fnil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`atsave = myaction`.

	**atdebug** 
	 A *callable* ``(elm, mflw, lw, [msg], [...])`` invoked at the entry and exit of element maps during the integration steps, i.e. within the slices. The arguments are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, the length weight of the integration step and a *string* specifying a debugging message, e.g. ``map_name:0`` for entry and ``":1"`` for exit. If the level ``debug`` :math:`\geq 4` and ``atdebug`` is not specified, the default *function* ``mdump`` is used. In some cases, extra arguments could be passed to the method. (default: ``fnil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`atdebug = myaction`.

	**info**
	 A *number* specifying the information level to control the verbosity of the output on the console. (default: ``nil``).
	 Example: :expr:`info = 2`.

	**debug**
	 A *number* specifying the debug level to perform extra assertions and to control the verbosity of the output on the console. (default: ``nil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`debug = 2`.

	**usrdef** 
	 Any user defined data that will be attached to the tracked map flow, which is internally passed to the elements method :meth:`:track` and to their underlying maps. (default: ``nil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`usrdef = { myvar=somevalue }`.

	**mflow** 
	 An *mflow* containing the current state of a ``track`` command. If a map flow is provided, all attributes are discarded except ``nstep``, ``info`` and ``debug``, as the command was already set up upon its creation. (default: ``nil``). 
	 Example: :expr:`mflow = mflow0`.

Dynamical tracking
------------------

:numref:`fig track trkslc` presents the scheme of the dynamical tracking through an element sliced with ``nslice=3``. The actions ``atentry`` (index ``- 1``), ``atslice`` (indexes ``0:math:`..`3``), and ``atexit`` (index ``- 2``) are reversed between the forward tracking (``dir=1`` with increasing :math:`s`-position) and the backward tracking (``dir=- 1`` with decreasing :math:`s`-position). By default, the action ``atsave`` is attached to the exit slice and the action ``ataper`` is attached to the last slice just before exit, i.e. to the last ``atslice`` action in the tilted frame, and hence they are also both reversed in the backward tracking.

Slicing
"""""""

	#.	 A *number* of the form :expr:`nslice=N` that specifies the number of slices with indexes :math:`0`..:math:`N`. This defines a uniform slicing with slice length :math:`l_{\text{slice}} = l_{\text{elem}}/N`.

	#.	 An *iterable* of the form ``nslice={lw_1,lw_2,..,lw_N}`` with :math:`\sum_i lw_i=1` that specifies the fraction of length of each slice with indexes :math:`0` .. :math:`N` where :math:`N`= ``#nslice``. This defines a non-uniform slicing with a slice length of :math:`l_i = lw_i\times l_{\text{elem}}`.

	#.	 A *callable* ``(elm, mflw, lw)`` returning one of the two previous forms of slicing. The arguments are in order, the current element, the tracked map flow, and the length weight of the step, which should allow to return a user-defined element-specific slicing.


The surrounding ``P`` and ``P^-1`` maps represent the patches applied around the body of the element to change the frames, after the ``atentry`` and before the ``atexit`` actions:

	#.	 The misalignment of the element to move from the *global frame* to the *element frame* if the command attribute ``misalign`` is set to ``true``.

	#.	 The tilt of the element to move from the element frame to the *titled frame* if the element attribute ``tilt`` is non-zero. The ``atslice`` actions take place in this frame.

The *map frame* is specific to some maps while tracking through the body of the element. In principle, the map frame is not visible to the user, only to the integrator. For example, a quadrupole with both ``k1`` and ``k1s`` defined will have a *map frame* tilted by the angle :math:`\alpha=-\frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}\frac{k1s}{k1}` attached to its thick map, i.e. the focusing matrix handling only :math:`\tilde{k}_1 = \sqrt{k1^2+k1s^2}`, but not to its thin map, i.e. the kick from all multipoles (minus ``k1`` and ``k1s``) expressed in the *tilted frame* , during the integration steps.

Sub-elements
""""""""""""

The ``track`` command takes sub-elements into account. In this case, the slicing specification is taken between sub-elements, e.g. 3 slices with 2 sub-elements gives a final count of 9 slices. It is possible to adjust the number of slices between sub-elements with the third form of slicing specifier, i.e. by using a callable where the length weight argument is between the current (or the end of the element) and the last sub-elements (or the start of the element).

Particles status
""""""""""""""""

The ``track`` command initializes the map flow with particles or damaps or both, depending on the attributes ``X0`` and ``mapdef``. The ``status`` attribute of each particle or damap will be set to one of ``"Xset"``, ``"Mset"``, and ``"Aset"`` to track the origin of its initialization: coordinates, damap, or normalizing damap (normal form or beta block). After the tracking, some particles or damaps may have the status ``"lost"`` and their number being recorded in the counter ``lost`` from TFS table header. Other commands like ``cofind`` or ``twiss`` may add extra tags to the status value, like ``"stable"``, ``"unstable"`` and ``"singular"``.
